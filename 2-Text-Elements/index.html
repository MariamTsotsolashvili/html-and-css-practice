    <h1>Development</h1>
    <p>In 1980, physicist <a href=“URL">Tim BERNERS-LEE's</a>, a contractor at <a href=“URL">CERN</a>, proposed and prototyped <a href=“URL">ENQUIRE</a>, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents.
         In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an <a href=“URL">internet</a>)-based <a href=“URL">hypertext</a> system.</p>

    <h1>January 14, 1997</h1>
    <p><b>HTML</b> 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the <b>W3C</b>, as the <b>IETF</b> had closed its <b>HTML</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Group</b> on September 12, 1996.
            ​Initially code-named "Wilbur", <b>HTML</b> 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. <b><i>Netscape's blink</i></b> element and <b><i>Microsoft's</i></b> marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.</p>

    <p>A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in MathML.</p>
